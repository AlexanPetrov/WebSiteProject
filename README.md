# WebSiteProject

This is assignment 5 in a series of 5 assignments. This one is totally different from the 
privious two because it's the first time I used HTML & CSS and made an attempt to build a 
website in general. It's been very refreshing to do something totally different, yet use newly
learned concenpts, namely Hash Tables.

The project is by no means finished. I still have to connect the search bar. As of now, it is
not functional. I just started learning JS, so this may take a couple of weeks given that 
I have to study for my other class. All other buttons/links are connected to each other.

I have not filled the website with relevant personal information simply because I have not
decided what I should put there. It will be the last stage of the project. Meanwhile, the space 
for inserting the information has been set up. 

The project consists of 8 files. (0. README)

1. Website. This section includes the Home code for my new website.
2. About. This section will have the general information about me/startup.
3. Contacts. This section will have the contacts/social media.
4. News. This one will have the relevant news.
5. Background. This one is a .jpg file containing the website background.
6. Games. This is an experimental section that will have a number of smart games designed
   to reboot the players mind and reset them mentally. More description on the website.
7. styles. This file consistes of the styles for all files present.
8. Projects. This one for now connects to my gitHub directly.
